Welcome to the new davewalk.net! This website could be considered version 3.0 of this tiny little place for myself on the Internet. Version 1 was a Drupal website (horrible idea although I learned some valuable lessons). Version 2 was a [Syte](https://github.com/rigoneri/syte) (still viewable, for now, [here](http://davewalk.herokuapp.com/)) website that while being an awesome idea, didn't really work for me because of slow page loads due to API calls to the Tumblr and search engine issues.

What you're looking at now is a static [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) website hosted on GitHub Pages which I believe will make it super simple to keep this website up-to-date. Blog posts are markdown files that I can write and preview in Sublime Text. I can create [Issues](https://github.com/davewalk/davewalk.net/issues) to remind myself of blog post ideas. And each blog post has a link at the bottom to the actual markdown file in the GitHub repo in case a reader wants to correct me on something. Yes, I agree that this probably won't be done very often.

There's still more to do too; I have to create a projects page to showcase the things I've worked on recently and a dedicated blog posts page with tags. I'm also going to make more of an effort to write new blog posts more often so check back soon!
