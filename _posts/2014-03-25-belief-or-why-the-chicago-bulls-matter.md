Anyone that knows me knows that I'm a huge NBA fan. You probably aren't, but stick with me on this one. It makes sense.  

The Chicago Bulls have been a successful team for a few years now. One reason for this is they are led by a hometown point guard named Derrick Rose. Although Rose was only 20 when he played his first NBA game for the Bulls, he quickly became their leader. His demeanor set a tone for the team; he's a super serious guy that doesn't smile or joke around a lot. He's known for reckless abandon on the court and putting his body on the line.  

But this really isn't a story about Derrick Rose, because he's been hurt pretty much all of the last two years. In April 2012 he tore the ACL in his left knee and didn't play the entire 2012-2013 season. He returned for the next season, but then hurt his right knee, causing him to be out AGAIN for an entire season. Two straight seasons, lost.  

But like I said, this isn't really about Rose. Because last year while most teams would re-build and call it a wash, the Bulls made a pretty good playoff run beating a Brooklyn Nets team with a big payroll and The Bulls starting point guard at the time
