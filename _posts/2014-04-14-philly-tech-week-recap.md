The fourth annual Philly Tech Week wrapped up this weekend and in my opinion it was the best yet. Why do I say this? Because I was exhausted by the end of it. He's a recap of the events that I was able to make it out to but there are many more that I missed:

**Saturday**: With the weather finally semi-decent, I biked north to ImpactHUB for this year's Redsnake Philly, a throwdown of Python vs. Ruby presentations. Not really, it wasn't combative, but there were plenty of fresh ideas on how Python and Ruby can be used to build faster and smarter. I particularly enjoyed Chris Conley's (of Monetate) exploration of the game of Hangman and how to optimize for information gain to win the game quicker on average. There's some code in [his GitHub repo](https://github.com/chrisconley/hangman) worth checking out. The most intriguing talk was by Stefan Natchev on [Lapis](http://leafo.net/lapis/), a web framework baked into Nginx written in Lua/MoonScript.  

Included in the swag for RedSnake Philly was this beanie which came in particularly useful as I rode down to the Art Museum for the [Arcade @ The Oval](http://2014.phillytechweek.com/events/Arcade-The_Oval) where this was happening:

Last year's pong on the Cira Centre was amazing but Tetris took it to the next level. The video can't really convey how awesome this was. I hung out for a bit near the table where the person playing the game was and in true Philly fashion people were cheering on when rows where removed and booing when the person went into a tailspin as the pieces started to pile up to the top and the end of the game was imminent. The event overall was blown out bigger than last year with tons of video games on various consoles for people to play, [DDR Connect Four](https://twitter.com/ddw17/status/452617712863555584), food trucks and great live 8-bit music from bands like [Cheap Dinosaurs](http://cheapdinosaurs.bandcamp.com/). Super fun event to cap off a great day.

**Tuesday**: It was tough to decide what to do go to Tuesday night but I ended up at Code For Philly which is a weekly hack night at Devnuts in Northern Liberties because I planned on starting a project that I'll be writing about here soon. CfP has always been a fun time but recently it's really been picking up the pace as there is a constant stream of new people getting involved. At this instance there were some high school kids that wanted to start a coding club at their school. Their dad was there too
