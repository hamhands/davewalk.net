<div class="post">
<p>It’s about that time again, isn’t it? For the past few years I’ve
tried to make and keep a list of New Year’s Resolutions. Problem is that
I’ve been changing my blogging platform so much that I can never link
back to review it a year later. Here’s to hoping this time is different.</p>

<p>2012 was an awesome year for me, probably the best of my life. Here’s
what happened to me this year:</p>

<ol>
<li> Got married</li>
<li> Got a great job that I really enjoy</li>
<li> Got to visit Paris, London and Brussels on our honeymoon. The first
time I’ve ever been outside of the United States</li>
<li> Got my Master’s Degree (pending, but I’m done with classes)</li>
</ol>

<p>While all of this was awesome, it’s all stuff that I <em>knew</em> was going to
happen and was already planning for in 2011. The challenge in 2013 is to
keep the momentum going after getting a lot of the big life things done.
So here’s what I’m shooting for in 2013.</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Learn HTML5 and the mobile web</strong>. I’ve started this already and
it’s clearly where the future of technology is going. A sub-goal
here is that every app I launch this year will look great on
smartphones, tablets and traditional desktops and a majority of them
will be designed for mobile first.</li>
<li> <strong>Learn Android</strong>. Yeah yeah, you can make more money in iOS, but
Android is going to continue to spread like a disease. Long term
this is a really good skill to have. Measurement: release at least
one app in the Google Play store. I’ve already got pretty solid
ideas for three, I just have to wrap my mind around how it all fits
together.</li>
<li> <strong>Learn functional programming by the way of Scala</strong>. I’ve started
this already by beginning the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Coursera’s Scala
class</a>. How awesome is it
to learn a programming language from its creator?! End goal: write
one substantial application in Scala.</li>
<li> <strong>Contribute to at least 3-5 open source projects</strong>. This could be
creating and maintaining something that others find useful or having
pull requests accepted for other projects.</li>
<li> <strong>Attend five hackathons</strong>. They’re a good way to stretch yourself,
code as a team under pressure and learn from others.</li>
<li> <strong>Learn D3.js</strong>. Like really learn it, not just make a few bar
charts. Make something cool. At least five original, substantial
data visualizations.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Run 750 miles</strong>. In 2010 I ran 1,000 miles, but I wasn’t able to
replicate that in 2011 due to injuries and just a lack of free time.
It’s not the energy that’s the problem but devoting 10+ hours a week
to running can be challenging. But 750 miles is a pretty healthy
number.</li>
<li> <strong>Less distractions</strong>. I’m constantly swamped in Google Reader like
it’s my job. I’ll have to make some subscription cuts to get my
unread count down and maybe sometimes “Mark all as read” button.
Also, cancel my magazine subscriptions (Wired and Fast Company).
There just isn’t enough time in the day to read everything I want to
read and I have to get used to that.</li>
<li> <strong>Read 12 books</strong>. In 2010 (man, I had free time in 2010) I read 24
books, which isn’t insane, just two books a month. While devoting
time to the above I think I can manage one book a month. Hopefully
more fiction than technology books to give myself a break.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Self Quantification</h3>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Get back onto Daytum</strong>. In the second half of 2011 I sort of fell
off with Daytum which I was putting a lot of data into every day. In
2013 I resolve to be more dedicated to it, but not for everything
but only the important stuff. Also, I’ll work towards visualizing
the large dataset that I currently have about myself.</li>
<li> <strong>Write five days a week in 750 Words</strong>. Writing in a journal helps
me reflect, especially at the beginning of end of a day.</li>
<li> <strong>Use at least one passive logging technique</strong>.
<a href="https://github.com/gurgeh/selfspy">Selfspy</a> looks interesting.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s about it. Some of this kind of scares me, but I guess that’s
the point. I doubt that anyone will find this interesting, but I have to
put this list out publicly to motivate myself to get to work. I’ll check
back in the beginning of 2014.</p>
