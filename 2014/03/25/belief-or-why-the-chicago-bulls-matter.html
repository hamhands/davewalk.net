<div class="post">
<p>Anyone that knows me knows that I&#39;m a huge NBA fan. You probably aren&#39;t, but stick with me on this one. It makes sense.  </p>

<p>The Chicago Bulls have been a successful team for a few years now. One reason is they are led by a hometown point guard named Derrick Rose. Although Rose was only 20 when he played his first NBA game for the Bulls, he quickly became their leader. His demeanor set a tone for the team; he&#39;s a super serious guy that doesn&#39;t smile or joke around a lot. He&#39;s known for reckless abandon on the court and putting his body on the line.  </p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t really a story about Derrick Rose, because in April 2012 he tore the ACL in his left knee and didn&#39;t play the entire 2012-2013 season. To most NBA fans when the star player goes down that team&#39;s year is pretty much over. But not for the Bulls, who shocked Brooklyn Nets, a team with a big payroll and big expectations that year in the playoffs. Their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Robinson">starting point guard at the time</a> was 5&#39;9&quot;, a living example of adversity of there ever was one (fun fact: I&#39;m an inch taller than a guy that plays in the NBA).  Plagued by injuries, they never stopped trying and they won a series that they had no reason to.  </p>

<p>This season Rose got hurt <em>again</em>, leading to a second straight lost year. Then the team traded their anchor and possibly their best player, Luol Deng. Now at this point do you think the team just felt bad about themselves and folded?</p>

<p>I try to catch the Bulls on TV whenever I can because afterwards I&#39;ll feel fired up and want to go do <em>something</em>. If I&#39;m on a treadmill watching a game I&#39;ll definitely be running a few extra miles. The Bulls push, they fight, they don&#39;t give up. They beat the other team not because they have a great gameplan or have the most talent, but because they&#39;re willing to go farther and sacrifice more. <a href="http://youtu.be/DmkeohReH4U?t=1m29s">Plays like this</a> from last night&#39;s win against a top team don&#39;t happen in every NBA game.  Sure, they&#39;re millionaires but they play against a bunch of other millionaires that they routinely out-hustle.</p>

<p>Belief. Belief in what you&#39;re working towards and your teammates no matter what adversity comes your way.  </p>

<p>Believing in a goal like the Bulls is something I&#39;m trying to work towards.</p>
