<div class="post">
<p>Welcome to the new davewalk.net! This website could be considered version 3.0 of this tiny little place for myself on the Internet. Version 1 was a Drupal website (horrible idea although I learned some valuable lessons). Version 2 was a <a href="https://github.com/rigoneri/syte">Syte</a> (still viewable, for now, <a href="http://davewalk.herokuapp.com/">here</a>) website that while being an awesome idea, didn&#39;t really work for me because of slow page loads due to API calls to the Tumblr and search engine issues.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re looking at now is a static <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> website hosted on GitHub Pages which I believe will make it super simple to keep this website up-to-date. Blog posts are markdown files that I can write and preview in Sublime Text. I can create <a href="https://github.com/davewalk/davewalk.net/issues">Issues</a> to remind myself of blog post ideas. And each blog post has a link at the bottom to the actual markdown file in the GitHub repo in case a reader wants to correct me on something. Yes, I agree that this probably won&#39;t be done very often.</p>

<p>There&#39;s still more to do too; I have to create a projects page to showcase the things I&#39;ve worked on recently and a dedicated blog posts page with tags. I&#39;m also going to make more of an effort to write new blog posts more often so check back soon!</p>
